![Ben Binder, Ph.D.](./github-banner.webp)

Hello! I am a seasoned developer, designer, and educator with a formidable technical skillset and a strong passion for innovative solutions in the field of educational technology. Currently a full-stack engineer eager to take the next step in my professional journey!

I have 6+ years of experience building applications for industry and higher education, and you can view selected samples of my work here or on my [portfolio](https://benbinder.net)! In addition to on-the-job experience, I also recently graduated from the University of Minnesota's Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp, which was a wonderful way to solidify and augment my technical skillset. I am proficient in a wide variety of industry standard tools for modern web development, including **Node.js/Express**, **React.js**, **Next.js**, **GraphQL**, and **MongoDB**.

I also have several years of experience using a host of other technologies including **PHP**, **Python**, **MySQL**, **C#**, **REST APIs**, **Apache**, and the **Unity** game engine.
